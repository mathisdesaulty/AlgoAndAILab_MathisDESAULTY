# Objects 

## ImageUser

Used to perform operations on images in the MNIST dataset, in particular to binarise them.

## MathTool

Enables you to perform mathematical operations on two-dimensional matrices. In particular distances, currently: Haussdorff distance, modified Haussdorff distance using sum, distance D6, D22 and D23. The other functions make these functions possible.

## KNNClassifierMINST

Use the previous two objects to use K-NNs to predict the label of an image based on its neighbours. The performance function gives an idea of the performance of the current algorithm.
